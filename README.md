# AI News Caster 🎙️

Daily AI news audio briefings — simple language, frank tone, no fluff.

## What This Is

A personal AI news digest system that:
- Aggregates the day's AI news from curated sources
- Generates a coherent 10-15 minute audio briefing
- Keeps a text ledger with source links for reference
- Delivers via WhatsApp voice note (or other channels)

## Why

Because doomscrolling Twitter/X for AI news is exhausting. One daily briefing > scattered anxiety.

## Features (Planned)

- [ ] Source aggregation (RSS, Twitter lists, newsletters)
- [ ] LLM-powered summarization and script generation
- [ ] TTS audio generation (ElevenLabs / OpenAI)
- [ ] Daily delivery scheduling
- [ ] Text archive with citations

## Stack (TBD)

- **Language:** Python / TypeScript
- **LLM:** Claude / GPT-4
- **TTS:** ElevenLabs or OpenAI
- **Delivery:** Clawdbot (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
